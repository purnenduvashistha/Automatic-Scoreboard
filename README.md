# Automatic-Scoreboard


## About The Project

Cricket is one of the most popuar games. The umpire in the game has the authority to make important decisions about events on the field. Umpire expresses his decisions using hand gestures. This project is about updating the scoreboard by recognising the hand gesture of the umpire. Pre-trained network, VGG19 has been used for the feature extraction and (SVM) classifier is trained on the extracted features for detecting the gesture of the umpire. The accuracy of the model is 76%. Soon, the model will also be able to predict the 3rd umpire decision and update the scoreboard accordingly.
